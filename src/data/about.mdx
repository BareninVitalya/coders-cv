I’m Brian, and I teach people how to use the Cloud. I’ve been active in Open Source for as long
as I’ve been coding — and that’s a long time.

With some friends, I wrote a [book about the Go programming language](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action).
I’ve given many [talks](/speaking) about Go, Distributed Computing, and programming in general.

Poke around and see what I’m up to. It’s all open source, so feel free to contribute.
