Hi, I’m **Alex Mitchell** — cloud architect, backend engineer, and open source enthusiast.
For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved building things for the web and sharing what I learn with others.

I believe in the power of **open source** and collaboration.
You’ll often find me contributing to projects like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), and [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform).

With colleagues and friends, I’ve helped create internal guides and even contributed to the book
[Go In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action), sharing insights from large-scale production environments.
