Howdy! Thanks for stopping by. I’m Brian and I’ve been doing technology
things since [acoustic modem couplers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler) were a thing.
I love Open Source and exploring different programming languages.
Some highlights about me and my activities:

**Army Veteran:** Bradley Fighting Vehicle Gunner, Infantry, 1st Armored Division

**Father of ~~four~~ five** with ~~19~~ 21 years difference between oldest and youngest child

**Co-founded GopherCon** — [the largest conference for Go developers](https://gophercon.com)

**Co-authored** [Go In Action](https://www.amazon.com/Go-Action-William-Kennedy/dp/1617291781) for Manning Publishing

**Co-wrote** Skynet and SkyDNS with Erik St. Martin, which was eventually morphed
into the DNS service discovery that powers Kubernetes

**Contributed** to the largest projects that power the Internet: Go, Kubernetes,
Etcd, and so many more

I love Open Source, learning in public, and sharing what I learn with others.
