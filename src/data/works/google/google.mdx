I've always believed that building scalable systems is more than just writing efficient code—it's a mindset. My time at Google (2017–2020) on the **Search Infrastructure team** allowed me to put this philosophy into practice.

I worked on several high-impact projects, such as:

1. **Ranking Engine Overhaul**
   - Refactoring critical ranking algorithms using `Go`
   - Integrating machine learning models developed in TensorFlow
   - Improving P99 latency significantly—from **1200 ms** down to **950 ms**

2. **Distributed Query Caching**
   - Built and optimized a caching layer with **Python** and **Redis**
   - Achieved a **50% cache-hit rate** at peak traffic

3. **Real-Time Analytics Pipeline**
   Developed a streaming analytics tool for monitoring search latency:

   ```js
   logs
     .filter(log => log.latency > 1000)
     .forEach(alert => sendAlert(alert))

### Key results of my contributions:

| Metric                 | Before  | After   |
|------------------------|--------:|--------:|
| P99 Latency (ms)       | 1200    | 950     |
| Cache Hit Rate (%)     | 35      | 50      |
| Throughput (queries/s) | 150 000 | 180 000 |

In addition to technical contributions, I mentored 5 interns, organized weekly tech talks, and actively contributed to open-source projects like [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io).

Here's a quick example of deploying one of our internal services:

```bash
kubectl apply -f google-search-deployment.yaml
```

I also shared my experience through public speaking and writing:

- **GopherCon 2018:** “Building Scalable Search Systems”
- **Google Official Blog:** “Distributed Tracing at Scale”
