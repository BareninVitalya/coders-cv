During the summer of 2015, I interned on the Azure team at Microsoft. My primary focus was on building internal CI/CD tooling to streamline deployments for large-scale cloud services. I collaborated closely with senior engineers to:

1. Design and implement automated pipelines using PowerShell and TypeScript.
2. Improve reliability by integrating end-to-end tests into the deployment process.
3. Document best practices and onboard new team members.

This internship solidified my passion for cloud infrastructure and automation, laying the groundwork for my future career in distributed systems.
